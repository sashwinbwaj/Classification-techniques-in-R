### Classification-techniques-in-R
This repository contains all my R scripts used for perform exploratory modelling on numerous public datasets.  
These include classification, regression, deep-learning, clustering, dimensionality reduction, associative rule learning, pre-preprocessing and reinforcement learning.

Check out the pdf for the markdown file containing the code as well as the end visualization results  
I have also added the public dataset as an excel file
