### Classification-techniques-in-R
This repository contains the files of my project to visualize a simple two feature model using various machine learning classification techniques including:

Logistic Regression  
K-Nearest Neighbours  
Decision Trees  
Random Forest Classifiers  
Linear Support Vector Machine  
Kernal (Gaussian) SVM  
Naive Bayes Classifier  

Check out the pdf for the markdown file containing the code as well as the end visualization results  
I have also added the public dataset as an excel file
